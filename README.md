## Overview
The following repo contains Code form Banking Mortgage Process.

### Customer Problem
The current process require submitting different customer requests in inside portal by Customer Relationship Specialists (based on phone conversations with different customers). The Inside Portal provides an ability to export requests for a complete day in the form of csv file. This csv file is then used as input to create customer specific Documents with relevant Terms and priviledge detailed Templates (current process involving manual steps). Once generated,  these documents require customer signature to confirm the acceptance of Terms and discussed plan.
